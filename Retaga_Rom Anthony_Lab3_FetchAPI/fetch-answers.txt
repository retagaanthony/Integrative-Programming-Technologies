1. What are the main differences between XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API?
- XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is older and uses callback functions, which can make the code longer and harder to read.
- Fetch API is newer, uses Promises, and provides a cleaner, simpler way to handle HTTP requests.

2. Why is the Fetch API considered more modern and readable?
- Fetch uses Promises, allowing easier chaining of actions using .then() and .catch().
- The syntax is shorter, clearer, and easier to understand compared to the nested structure of XHR.

3. What is the purpose of the .then() and .catch() methods in Fetch?
- .then() handles a successful response from the server (like parsing JSON or displaying data).
- .catch() handles errors, such as network problems or invalid responses.

4. What happens when you send a POST request to the placeholder API?
- The JSONPlaceholder API doesn’t actually save new data, but it simulates a successful response.
- It returns a fake new post with an ID of 101, confirming the request worked.
